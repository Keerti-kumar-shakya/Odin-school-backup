    <p><b>Algebra</b> is a way of working with numbers and signs to answer a <b>mathematics problem</b> (a question using numbers). You use Algebra in life.</p>

       <p> It answers, for example, questions like these:</p>   
        
       <p> If I have 10 coins and need 25 coins to get a book, how many more coins do I need to get the book?</p>
        
        <p>If you have 6 bottles of milk and you drink 2 bottles in a day, how many days will your milk last?</p>   
        
        <p>If you start running a race at a speed of 10 kilometers an hour, and your friend starts running 10 minutes later at a speed of 15 kilometers an hour, when will your friend catch up to you?</p>
        
       <p>Algebra helps answer questions when building houses, making food, and doing science work.</p>
        
        <p>This book will help you learn how to do mathematics using Algebra. It has <b>chapters</b> (parts of the book) with <b>lessons</b> (parts of the chapter about one idea).</p>
        
       <p>A lesson has five parts:</p>
        
        <p>Vocabulary - lists special words you need for the lesson.</p>

        <p>- explains a new idea and how to use this idea.</p>

        <p>Example Problems - demonstrates the steps to complete problems using the new idea.</p>

        <p>Practice Games - provides entertaining challenges in which you complete math problems.</p>

        <p>Practice Problems - You practice your skills while completing problems.</p>

        <p>A lesson has five parts:</p>
