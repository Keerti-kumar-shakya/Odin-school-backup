<p>An  <b>operation</b> is a thing you do to numbers. You use signs like: <b> +, –, ×, or ÷ </b>for operations.</p>
<p>The <b>equals </b> sign is not an operation. You use the " = " sign for the equals sign. It is a special sign that you put between two things that are the same.</p>
<h3><b>Adding</b></h3>
<p>Adding is a way to put two numbers together. You use the " <b>+</b> " sign for the adding operation. If you have 5 apples and a friend has 6 apples, you and your friend have 11 apples. This is <b>5 + 6 = 11</b> using the signs of Mathematics, and is read "<b>five plus six equals eleven</b>".
</p>
<p>Order is not important when adding. <b>2 + 3</b> is the same as <b>3 + 2</b>.</p>
<h3>Subtracting</h3>
<p>Subtracting is a way of taking a number from another number. It is the opposite of adding. You use the " – " sign for the subtracting operation. If you have 5 apples and give 3 to a friend, you then have 2 apples left. This is <b>5 – 3 = 2</b> using the signs of Mathematics, and is read <b>"five minus three equals two"</b>.
</p>
<p>Order is important when subtracting. <b>3 – 2</b> is not the same as <b>2 – 3</b>.</p>
<h3>Multiplying</h3>
<p>Multiplying is a way of adding a number many times. You use the " × ", " • " or " * " sign for the multiplying operation. If you have 4 apple trees and every tree has 25 apples, you have 100 apples. This is <b>4 × 25 = 100 or 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100</b> in the signs of Mathematics. The first way is shorter and easier to use.
</p>
<p>Multiplying 25 by 4 is the same as adding 25, 4 times or adding 4, 25 times.</p>
<p><b>4 x 25 = 100</b> should be read <b>"four times twenty-five equals one hundred"</b>.</p>
<h3>Dividing</h3>
<p>Dividing is a way of subtracting a number many times. It is the opposite of multiplying. You use the " ÷ " or " / " sign for the dividing operation. If 3 friends take an equal part of a bag of 12 apples, every friend gets 4 apples. Or, you may take away (subtract) 3 apples from the bag of 12 apples, exactly 4 times until the bag is empty. This is <b>12 ÷ 3 = 4 or 12 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 = 0</b> in the signs of Mathematics.
</p>
<p><b>12 ÷ 3 = 4</b> should be read <b>"twelve divided by three equals 4"</b>.</p>
